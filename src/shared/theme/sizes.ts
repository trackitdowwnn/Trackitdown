/**
 * WHAT:  Control-sizing tokens (heights that recur across interactive
 *        elements).
 * WHY:   Inputs and buttons share a 52pt control height (>= the 44pt minimum
 *        touch target in DESIGN_SYSTEM). Naming it keeps those heights in sync
 *        and out of component code as magic numbers.
 * LINKS: docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (Core components: Button height 52; Accessibility
 *        44pt touch targets).
